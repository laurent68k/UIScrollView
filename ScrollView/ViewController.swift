     Basically what you need is 9 constraints (assuming you want to scroll only vertically):

     1-4: ScrollView to Superview (top, bottom, leading, trailing). Make sure to connect it to parent view and not to safe area.

     5-8: Content view to Content Layout guide (top, bottom, leading, trailing).

     Content view Width equals width to Frame Layout Guide.
